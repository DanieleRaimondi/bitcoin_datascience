    "# Ensemble Model Optimization Using Historical Tops and Bottoms\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I optimize the parameters of our ensemble model using historical price extremes (tops and bottoms) as reference points. This step is crucial for fine-tuning the model to capture significant turning points in the Bitcoin market, which are critical for predicting future price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dates for Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "I specify dates that historically represent major top and bottom prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Tops Dates**: These are the dates when Bitcoin reached peak prices.\n",
    "*   **Bottoms Dates**: These are the dates when Bitcoin saw significant lows.\n",
    "\n",
    "These dates are used to anchor our model during optimization, ensuring it captures these critical inflection points accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **initial\\_guess**: Initial estimates for the parameters, which guide the starting point of our optimization algorithm.\n",
    "*   **bounds**: Constraints for each parameter to prevent overfitting and ensure the model remains generalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to minimize the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the model's predictions and actual observed prices at these historical tops and bottoms. This process adjusts the model parameters to better align with Bitcoin's observed price behavior, improving predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The `optimize_params` function is used, which employs a boundary-limited version of the L-BFGS-B optimization algorithm, a popular choice for model fitting in machine learning due to its efficiency in handling potentially complex landscapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of Parameters and Their Interaction with Cubic and Log Models\n",
    "`optimized_params` is an array of four values.\n",
    "Let's dive in:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Upper Decay (`upper_decay`)**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *   **Role**: Controls the rate at which the influence of older data decreases for the upper band predictions.\n",
    "    *   **Interaction**: Primarily affects the temporal dynamics of how both the cubic and log model predictions are integrated over time. A higher `upper_decay` value means that recent predictions (from both models) retain their influence longer, which could be crucial in volatile markets where recent trends are significant.\n",
    "2.  **Upper Max Weight (`upper_maxw`)**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *   **Role**: Sets the maximum limit on the influence of the log model for the upper band.\n",
    "    *   **Interaction**: By capping how much the log model can influence the upper band, this parameter indirectly enhances the relative influence of the cubic model when the log model's contribution is at its maximum threshold. Essentially, it adjusts the balance of influence between the cubic and log models for the upper prediction band.\n",
    "3.  **Lower Decay (`lower_decay`)**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *   **Role**: Similar to the upper decay but for the lower prediction band, it dictates how quickly past influences diminish.\n",
    "    *   **Interaction**: A positive `lower_decay` (as typically expected) would function similarly to the upper decay but for the lower band. If it's negative (which is unconventional), this could imply increasing influence over time, suggesting an atypical modeling choice where past trends grow in importance, potentially adjusting how both models' past outputs affect current predictions.\n",
    "4.  **Lower Max Weight (`lower_maxw`)**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *   **Role**: Restricts the maximum impact of the log model on the lower band predictions.\n",
    "    *   **Interaction**: A negative max weight unusually suggests that increases in the log model's output might inversely affect the ensemble's predictions, decreasing the lower band's predictions as the log model outputs higher values. This might be used to counter potential overshooting by the log model in downward trends, thereby stabilizing the lower band and giving more stabilizing control to the cubic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Model Weighting Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ensemble model:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Upper Band Weighting**: The combination of `upper_decay` and `upper_maxw` determines how responsive the upper band is to new data and how strongly the log model can peak within this band. The cubic model's influence increases as the log model's influence reaches the capped limit set by `upper_maxw`.\n",
    "*   **Lower Band Weighting**: With `lower_decay` and `lower_maxw`, the dynamics are about stabilizing predictions against sharp downturns, where a conventional positive decay would smooth the integration of new data, and a typical positive max weight would limit log model's downward influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adjusting these parameters, I can finely tune how aggressively or conservatively the ensemble model responds to market changes, leveraging strengths from both the cubic and log models to produce balanced and robust predictions. Remember that these four values are returned by the optimizer, which minimizes the MAPE (distance) between the bands and the prices provided."
