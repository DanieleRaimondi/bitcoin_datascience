## List of projects: üìù


## 1.Growth:

#### ThermoModel üå°Ô∏è ![](output/1a.ThermoModel.jpg)
The ThermoModel project aims to predict and analyze Bitcoin price movements by integrating cubic and logarithmic regression models. 
Through the creation of dynamic price bands and oscillators, it seeks to identify potential buy and sell zones, providing a comprehensive tool for understanding market trends and making informed investment decisions in the cryptocurrency space.

#### LogTimeLogPrice ü™ú ![](output/1b.LogTimeLogPrice.jpg)
This study is a powerful tool designed to analyze Bitcoin's price growth over time using a log-log graph. In addition to plotting support and resistance lines using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, this function introduces an oscillator subplot. This oscillator provides insights into market sentiment, aiding investors in identifying potential buy and sell signals based on deviations from the trend lines.

#### AritmTimeLogPrice ‚öôÔ∏è ![](output/1c.AritmTimeLogPrice.jpg)
This section demonstrates an exponential transformation of the time dimension in the LogTimeLogPrice model. This transformation is applied to ensure the results are comparable with those of the ThermoModel.

#### ThermoLogTimeLogPrice üí™üèª ![](output/1d.EnsembleCorridor.jpg)
Here I present a straightforward ensemble of the ThermoModel and LogTimeLogPrice models. The purpose is to average the predicted upper and lower bands from both models, providing a more robust forecast.

#### Slopes Growth Model ü™¥ ![](output/1e.SlopesGrowthModel.jpg)
This model analyzes Bitcoin's diminishing returns by connecting historical peaks and bottoms with regression lines, then forecasting future cycles using exponential decay convergence. As Bitcoin matures, growth rates naturally decline and converge toward a stable target, creating a narrowing price corridor that reflects the transition from explosive early growth to more mature market behavior over time.

#### BTC vs Supply üí≠ ![](output/1f.BTCvsSupply.jpg)
This analysis explores the growth correlation between Bitcoin's supply curve and its price history, to gain insights into how Bitcoin's programmed scarcity might influence its value over time.

#### BTC SMA üí≠ ![](output/1g.BTC_SMA.jpg)
In this visualization, we display the Bitcoin price movement in comparison to its Simple Moving Average (SMA) calculated over 209 weeks. The reason for choosing 209 weeks is linked to the Bitcoin halving cycle, which occurs every 4 years, approximately equivalent to 209 weeks. It has always been a great support of Bitcoin's prices.


## 2.Cycles:

#### Cycles üß≤ ![](output/2a.Cycles.jpg)
The Cycles project aims to analyze and visualize the cyclical patterns in Bitcoin's price movements, with a particular focus on the four-year cyclicity dictated by Bitcoin halving events. 
This approach provides insights into potential market trends and key turning points, highlighting how these critical halving milestones impact the broader cyclical behavior of Bitcoin's market value.

#### CyclesNorm üîÑ ![](output/2b.CyclesNorm.jpg)
This analysis examines Bitcoin's price movements across multiple halving cycles, visualizing historical patterns and projecting potential future trends based on cycle alignment. By normalizing price data from the 2016, 2020, and 2024 halving cycles, the model enables direct comparison of market behavior across different periods, identifying key inflection points, and projecting the timing of potential tops and bottoms. The visualization includes color-coded background shading for different market phases and a sinusoidal overlay to represent the cyclical nature of Bitcoin price movements.

#### MVRV üîã ![](output/2c.MVRV_Oscillator.jpg)
The MVRV project explores the relationship between Bitcoin's market and realized values by analyzing the MVRV ratio and price data to pinpoint market tops and bottoms. 
It introduces an oscillator for easy identification of overbought and oversold zones, highlighting the cyclical nature of Bitcoin with two peaks per cycle, where the second typically marks the ATH. 
This analysis aids in making informed investment decisions by understanding market trends and cycles.

#### Epochs Growth üìÜ ![](output/2c.EpochsGrowth.jpg)
This section presents a visualization of Bitcoin's price growth since each halving event. It's useful to evaluate the diminishing returns effect over time.


## 3.Economics:

#### Economics ü™ô ![](output/3a.Economics.jpg)
This chart helps analyze how U.S. macroeconomic indicators relate to Bitcoin's price by displaying them together on a single chart. This allows for easier understanding of their interactions and influences.

#### BTC vs Liquidity ü§ë ![](output/3c.BTCvsLiquidity.jpg)
The plot illustrates the relationship between Bitcoin's price (BTC) and two important economic indicators:
The money supply shows a strong correlation with Bitcoin's price movements, highlighting how the increase in liquidity drives demand for Bitcoin as an asset.

#### DXY üí≤ ![](output/3b.DXY.jpg)
This study aims to analyze the relationship between Bitcoin prices (PriceUSD) and the US Dollar Index (DXY) over time. 
The hypothesis is that since BTC is backed by USD, it is significantly affected by the performance of DXY. 
I am using LOESS (Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) to visualize trends and their derivatives, providing insights into market behaviors during different periods.
Actually, as I expected, during the BTC depression phases, DXY is strong and growing. Instead, while BTC skyrockets, DXY is suffering and declining. It can be observed that, during the inbetween phases, DXY is stable.


## 4.Supply & Demand:

#### BTC vs M2 üïØ ![](output/4a.BTCvsM2.jpg)
This section aims to compare Bitcoin's supply dynamics with the M2 money supply to highlight their fundamental differences in growth patterns, control mechanisms, and responses to economic conditions. The goal is to illustrate Bitcoin's potential as a stable store of value against the inflationary nature of traditional monetary systems.

#### Available Supply üí∞ ![](output/4b.AvailableSupply.jpg)
The project aims to estimate the percentage of Bitcoin that has been lost over time and predict the future available supply of Bitcoin, accounting for both the total supply limit and the estimated loss rate of coins. 
By modeling Bitcoin's supply growth and applying a decaying loss rate to simulate the reduction in lost coins over time, the project forecasts the effective supply available for circulation. 
This approach helps understand the dynamics affecting Bitcoin's scarcity and potential market impact, providing insights into how the diminishing supply and lost coins could influence Bitcoin's value in the long term.

#### Demand üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ![](output/4c.Demand.jpg)
This study aims to analyze on-chain Bitcoin data to gain a deeper understanding of Bitcoin demand over time. By examining key metrics such as the number of active addresses and the total transaction count alongside Bitcoin's price, we can uncover valuable insights into market dynamics. These two metrics serve as proxies for estimating Bitcoin demand, showcasing a clear growth trend over time. As Bitcoin's adoption increases, these metrics provide a tangible measure of user engagement and transaction activity on the network.

## 5.Cohorts:

#### Cohorts üêã ![](output/Cohorts_BTC/7_10K_to_100K_BTC.jpeg)
The project focuses on visualizing Bitcoin's distribution across address cohorts over time, highlighting balance ranges and applying LOESS smoothing to identify correlations with market behavior. 
By examining the reactions of different holder types to market changes, it reveals patterns of accumulation and distribution, offering insights into market sentiment and potential price trends.

## 6.Sentiment:

#### Google Trends üîç ![](output/6a.GoogleTrends.jpeg)
The purpose of this study is to explore the correlation between Google search interest for specific cryptocurrencies and their price fluctuations over time. The hypothesis is that search trends might serve as a proxy for sentiment, potentially acting as an indicator of market behavior.

## 7.US Elections:

#### BTC vs US ELECTIONS üá∫üá∏ ![](output//7a.BTCvsUSELECTIONS.jpg)
This analysis aims to explore the potential correlation between Bitcoin's price and Donald Trump's probability of winning the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. The hypothesis is that political uncertainty, particularly the prospect of a Bitcoin-friendly president, may influence Bitcoin's value. By examining this relationship, we seek to determine whether election probabilities can serve as a predictive tool for Bitcoin price movements. Identifying a strong correlation could provide insights into forecasting Bitcoin's price based on political sentiment surrounding the election. Data for election probabilities are sourced from Polymarket.

#### Bitcoin Price Correlation with US Elections üó≥Ô∏è ![](output/7b.US_Elections.jpg)
This analysis expands on my previous study by examining the broader relationship between Bitcoin price movements and significant political events globally. Beyond just the U.S. elections, we investigate how regulatory announcements, policy shifts, and major political transitions across different regions impact Bitcoin's volatility and overall trend. Through time-series analysis and correlation studies, we aim to identify patterns that might help predict how future political developments could influence the cryptocurrency market. This research provides investors with additional context for understanding Bitcoin's reaction to the geopolitical landscape.
